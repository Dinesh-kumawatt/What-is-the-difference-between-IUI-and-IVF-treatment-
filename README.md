# What-is-the-difference-between-IUI-and-IVF-treatment-

IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) is simple and cheaper treatment. In IUI, sperm is washed and put directly into the uterus during ovulation. IVF (In-Vitro Fertilization) is more advanced â€“ egg is taken out, fertilized with sperm outside, and embryo is transferred back.

IUI is useful when sperm is slightly weak or unexplained infertility. IVF is better for blocked tubes, severe male infertility, or when IUI fails.

Cost is also different â€“ IUI is around â‚¹10,000â€“20,000 and IVF is â‚¹1â€“2 lakhs. But success rate of IVF is much higher.

Ayuh Fertility Centre gives both treatments and helps you choose based on your case. They donâ€™t push IVF directly.
